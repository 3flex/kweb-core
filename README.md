## Kweb

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges) [![](https://jitpack.io/v/sanity/kweb.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#sanity/kweb) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sanity/kweb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sanity/kweb)

Kweb is a library for building rich web applications in the Kotlin programming language. You can think of it as a 
powerful Kotlin DSL that allows you to remote-control web browsers from a web server.  

It is most similar to [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/home) but native to Kotlin, taking full advantage of Kotlin features like [coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines).

Rather than include it's own UI framework it lets you interact directly with the DOM, and/or use any one of several JavaScript frameworks via a plugin mechanism.  It's also designed to be easy to add to a pre-existing project.

As of April 2017 Kweb remains experimental and is not currently recommended for production use.  However, we are very interested in finding people to help us with it.
