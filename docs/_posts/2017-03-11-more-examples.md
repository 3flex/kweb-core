#### Material Design Lite plugin

[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) is a JavaScript framework by Google let's you add a "material design"
look to your websites.

Kweb includes a fairly comprehensive plugin for MDL, supporting most MDL components.  The plugin API is designed
to mirror the library API.

See [here](https://github.com/sanity/kweb/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/sanity/kweb/demos/materialDesignLite/materialDesignLite.kt) 
for a usage example.

The MDL plugin's implementation can be seen [here](https://github.com/sanity/kweb/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/sanity/kweb/plugins/materialdesignlite).

#### Asynchronous usage

[This demo](https://github.com/sanity/kweb/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/sanity/kweb/demos/async/async.kt) 
illustrates Kweb's powerful asynchronous features and how Kotlin's `future {}` construct can be used efficiently.

#### Select 2 plugin

[select2](https://select2.github.io/) is a JavaScript library that gives you a customizable select box with support for 
searching, tagging, remote data sets, infinite scrolling, and many other highly used options.

See [this demo](https://github.com/sanity/kweb/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/sanity/kweb/demos/plugins/select2/select2demo.kt)
for a usage example.

See [here](https://github.com/sanity/kweb/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/github/sanity/kweb/plugins/select2) for the 
implementation of the select2 plugin.
